# Backend Setup Guide

## Introduction

This is the backend setup guide for the website. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get the backend server up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Installation

In your terminal.
Navigate to the 'foodie-file-server' directory.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

Starting the Server
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server by running the following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

This command will start the backend server on port 4500.

## Additional Notes

Ensure that no other application is running on port 4500 before starting the server.
